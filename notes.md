## Getting the :has() Selector Working in Firefox Dev Edition

By default the :has() selector isn't enabled in Firefox. Since my default browser is Firefox Developer Edition this took some research - first to figure out that it not being enabled was the issue, then how to enable it.

I found this [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73936048/how-do-you-enable-has-selector-on-firefox) useful.
